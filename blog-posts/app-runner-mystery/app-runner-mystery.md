## Introduction

I plan to monitoring system with Datadog at office. At first, I prepared EC2 server for running Datadog Agent to monitor media servers and DB. However, I think that it's a waste of cost to run server just starting Datadog Agent. So I decided to migrate Datadog Agent from EC2 to ECS.
