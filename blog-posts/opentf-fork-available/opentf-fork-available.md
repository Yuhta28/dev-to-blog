## Introduction

In August 2023, HashiCorp, a developer of OSS such as Terraform, switched Terraform from an open source license to the Business Source License (BSL).

This license change will not directly affect HashiCorp users of Terraform and other products. However, there is a movement against HashiCorp's license change, and a group has emerged that is aiming for true open source, forked from Terraform. It is OpenTF Foundation.
