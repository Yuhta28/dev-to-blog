## Introduction

In August 2023, HashiCorp, a developer of OSS such as Terraform, switched Terraform from an open source license to the Business Source License (BSL).

This license change will not directly affect HashiCorp users of Terraform and other products. However, there is a movement against HashiCorp's license change, and a group has formed to pursue true open source, forked from Terraform. It is OpenTF Foundation.

According to the manifesto, the OpenTF Foundation had demanded that HashiCorp switch Terraform back to an open-source license in order for Terraform to remain truly open source, and stated that it would maintain OpenTF forked from Terraform, if HashiCorp would not.

And so, on September 6, 2023 OpenTF was forked.
