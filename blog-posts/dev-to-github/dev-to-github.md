## Introduction

I blog in Japanese at [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/), community of engineers to help one another out. Zenn makes us able to manage our blogs in GitHub repository and to write articles in my favorite editor. In addition, I merge articles into main branch they would automatically be published to my blog with CI/CD.  
I wish that dev.to blog in the same way.
